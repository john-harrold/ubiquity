</h2>
<p>The workshop (<a href="https://ubiquity-pkpd.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/files/ubiquity_workshop.zip" class="external-link">workshop.ubiquity.tools</a>) provides several examples of how to perform simulations in ubiquity. To make a copy of these scripts and other supporting files in the current working directory run the following:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="kw"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/library.html" class="external-link">library</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va"><a href="https://ubiquity.tools/rworkflow" class="external-link">ubiquity</a></span><span class="op">)</span>
<span class="va">fr</span> <span class="op">=</span> <span class="fu"><a href="../reference/workshop_fetch.html">workshop_fetch</a></span><span class="op">(</span>section<span class="op">=</span><span class="st">"Simulation"</span>, overwrite<span class="op">=</span><span class="cn">TRUE</span><span class="op">)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This should create the following scripts:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>analysis_single.r</code> Simulating the response for a single indiviudal</li>
<li>
<code>analysis_multiple.r</code> Mote Carlo simulations using IIV</li>
<li>
<code>analysis_multiple_file.r</code> Monte Carlo simulations reading subject information from a file</li>
</ul>
<p>These rely on a PK model of mAbs in humans (<a href="https://doi.org/10.4161/mabs.29095" class="external-link">Davda etal. mAbs, 6(4), 1094-1102</a>). The contents of the system file for this model can be seen at the bottom (use <code><a href="../reference/system_new.html">?system_new</a></code> to see a list of the available system file examples). The first step in any analysis (simulation, estimation, etc) is building the system file creating the ubiquity model object (<code>cfg</code>).</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="va">cfg</span> <span class="op">=</span> <span class="fu"><a href="../reference/build_system.html">build_system</a></span><span class="op">(</span>system_file <span class="op">=</span> <span class="st">"system.txt"</span><span class="op">)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>After building any system you can then create templates. To create a template script for running simulations use <code>system_fetch_template</code> and specify <code>"Simulation"</code> as the template argument:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="fu"><a href="../reference/system_fetch_template.html">system_fetch_template</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va">cfg</span>, template<span class="op">=</span><span class="st">"Simulation"</span><span class="op">)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This will create the file <code>analysis_simulate.R</code> in the working directory. This template should have common options and dosing information commented out. You simply need to uncomment them and run the simulation.</p>
</div>
<div id="simulating-an-individual-response-analysis_single-r" class="section level2">
<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#simulating-an-individual-response-analysis_single-r" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"></a>Simulating an Individual Response (<code>analysis_single.r</code>)</h2>
<p>We’ll begin by demonstrating how to simulate an indiviudal response to dosing. The system parameters for the default parameter set can be pulled out of this object:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="va">cfg</span> <span class="op">=</span> <span class="fu"><a href="../reference/build_system.html">build_system</a></span><span class="op">(</span>system_file <span class="op">=</span> <span class="st">"system.txt"</span><span class="op">)</span>
<span class="va">parameters</span> <span class="op">=</span> <span class="fu"><a href="../reference/system_fetch_parameters.html">system_fetch_parameters</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va">cfg</span><span class="op">)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>To alter system parameters at the scripting level, you can just reassign the elements in <code>parameters</code>. For example to change the celarance to a value of .015 you could simply use: <code>parameters$CL = 0.15</code>.</p>
<p>Next different simulation options can be set. For example the following will set the duration of the simulation to three months <span class="math inline">\(\left(3\ \mbox{months} \times 4\frac{\mbox{weeks}}{\mbox{month}}\times7\frac{\mbox{days}}{\mbox{week}}\right)\)</span> in days:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb5"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="va">cfg</span> <span class="op">=</span> <span class="fu"><a href="../reference/system_set_option.html">system_set_option</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va">cfg</span>, group  <span class="op">=</span> <span class="st">"simulation"</span>, 
                             option <span class="op">=</span> <span class="st">"output_times"</span>, 
                             <span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/seq.html" class="external-link">seq</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="fl">0</span>,<span class="fl">3</span><span class="op">*</span><span class="fl">4</span><span class="op">*</span><span class="fl">7</span>,<span class="fl">1</span><span class="op">)</span><span class="op">)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The system file is written to allow both IV (<code>Cp</code>) and SC (<code>At</code>) dosing. So we zero out any default dosing specified in the system file. The next line specifies the SC dosing we want to simulate.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb6"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="va">cfg</span> <span class="op">=</span> <span class="fu"><a href="../reference/system_zero_inputs.html">system_zero_inputs</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va">cfg</span><span class="op">)</span>

                            values <span class="op">=</span> <span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/c.html" class="external-link">c</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="fl">200</span>, <span class="fl">200</span>, <span class="fl">200</span>, <span class="fl">200</span> <span class="op">)</span><span class="op">)</span> <span class="co">#  mg</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Next we run the simulation:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb7"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="va">som</span> <span class="op">=</span> <span class="fu"><a href="../reference/run_simulation_ubiquity.html">run_simulation_ubiquity</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va">parameters</span>, <span class="va">cfg</span><span class="op">)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The variable <code>som</code> is a list containing the mapped simulation output, and the time course is stored in the <code>simout</code> element. The first column (<code>time</code>) contains the simulation time in the units of the simulation, days in this case. Next there is a column for each state (<code>At</code>, <code>Cc</code>, <code>Cp</code>) and a column for each output (<code>C_ng_ml</code>, <code>C_DOSE</code>). Each system parameter is passed through the simulation into the output (<code>F1</code>, … <code>MW</code>). This model has two covariates specified DOSE and WT. The initial value of these covariates is passed through as well as the values at each time point. For the covariate <code>DOSE</code> this is <code>SIMINT_CVIC_DOSE</code> and <code>DOSE</code>, respectively. Next secondary parameters are also provided (<code>kel</code>, … <code>kpc</code>). Lastly each timescale specified in the system file is also passed through with a “<code>ts.</code>” prefix:</p>

<p>Subject information can be pulled from a data file. First we need to load the dataset using <code>system_load_data</code>, here the dataset is named <code>SUBS</code>.</p>

<p>The format of the dataset is shown below. There needs to be an column for the subject ID (<code>SIMINT_ID</code>) and the simulation time (<code>SIMINT_TIME</code>). Next the subject level parameters can be specified where the column headers correspond to the parameter names. If a parameter is not specified, the default value will be taken from the <code>parameters</code> input. In this case <code>MW</code> was not specified in the dataset, so it will be taken from <code>parameters</code>.</p>
<p>Optionally, covariates can also be specified by name as well. For time varying covariates, multiple records can be specified for the same subject (the parameter values for that subject should remain constant between records). In this example <code>WT</code> and <code>SEX</code> are covariates but only <code>WT</code> has been defined in the system file, so <code>SEX</code> will be ignored. The covariate <code>DOSE</code> is not defined so the default from the system file will be used.</p>

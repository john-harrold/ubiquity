### Overview  

Provides an interface to the R workflow for [ubiquity](<https://r.ubiquity.tools>): a set of modeling tools created to accelerate the development and deployment of models of drug disposition and efficacy within an organization or institution. It is designed to make model development easier, reduce the pain when moving between modeling software, and provide a simple but customizable interface to allow other scientists to interrogate models. It is provide free under a BSD license with source code available in GitHub ([R-package](https://github.com/john-harrold/ubiquity), [ubiquity project](https://github.com/john-harrold/ubiquity-pkpd)).

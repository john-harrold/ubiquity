Description: Complete work flow for the analysis of pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic (PKPD), physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) and systems pharmacology models including: creation of ordinary differential equation-based models, pooled parameter estimation, individual/population based simulations, rule-based simulations for clinical trial design and modeling assays, deployment with a customizable 'Shiny' app, and non-compartmental analysis. System-specific analysis templates can be generated and each element includes integrated reporting with 'PowerPoint' and 'Word'.
